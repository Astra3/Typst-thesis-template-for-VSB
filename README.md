# Typst template for creating a bachelor's thesis
### What is included in this repo:
#### üìò .typ files:
1. A **main.typ** file - the template file which already has some data written in it
2. A **thesis_template/template.typ** file (also referred to as funcon) - imports all of the needed functions that were created specifically for the template

#### üìÑ Other files:
3. CZ and ENG visuals folder (for logos)
4. A folder for images / figures for demonstrating images in the demo file (can be repurposed for someone's thesis files)

‚ÄºÔ∏è Make sure to edit the following when writing your thesis:

1. The title, author and keywords values in the **main.typ** file (at the very top of the file)
2. The language setting in the **main.typ** file ("cs" or "en", "sk" is not supported in typst)
3. You may delete the comment block in the **main.typ** file <br />
4. Your abstracts, keywords and symbols and abbreviations in the **main.typ** file (lower in the document)

<br />
