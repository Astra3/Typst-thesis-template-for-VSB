# Typst template for creating a bachelor's thesis
## What is included in this repo:
### üìò .typ files:
1. A **main.typ** file - the showcase file which already has some data written in it
2. A **thesis_template** .typ files - template.typ imports all of the needed functions that were created specifically for the template, the other files are modularised

### üìÑ Other files:
3. A folder for logos (in the thesis_template folder, NOT images)
4. A folder for images / figures for demonstrating images in the demo file (can be repurposed for someone's thesis files)
5. A PDF file of main.typ for showcasing purposes
6. A bibliography file for the demo

‚ÄºÔ∏è Make sure to edit the following when writing your thesis:

1. The title, author and keywords values
2. The language setting ("cs" or "en", "sk" is not supported in typst)
3. Your abstracts, keywords and symbols and abbreviations
4. Indent settings

## What the template can't do yet
- Ph.D. thesis
- Slovak language (though it's not supported in typst yet either, you can submit a PR here and to typst)

## What are some things to change
- It would be nice to use [linguify](https://github.com/typst-community/linguify) package for translations
